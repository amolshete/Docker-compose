## Docker Compose Overview

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.

### Why Use Compose?

#### Key Benefits
- **Simplified Control**: Define and manage multi-container applications in a single YAML file, making orchestration and coordination easier.
  
- **Efficient Collaboration**: Easy-to-share configuration files facilitate collaboration among developers, operations teams, and stakeholders.

- **Rapid Development**: Compose caches configurations, enabling quick environment changes and restarts.

- **Portability**: Support for variables allows customization for different environments or users.

- **Community Support**: Benefit from a vibrant community with abundant resources and tutorials.

### Common Use Cases

#### Development Environments
- Run applications in isolated environments and interact with them.
- Create and start containers for each dependency with a single command.

#### Automated Testing Environments
- Create and destroy isolated testing environments conveniently.
- Define environments in a Compose file for easy management.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Installed the latest version of Docker Compose
3. Run the following commands:
docker compose up

Compose pulls a Redis image, builds an image for your code, and starts the services you defined. In this case, the code is statically copied into the image at build time.
4. Enter http://<IP>:8000/ in a browser to see the application running.
5. If you want to run your services in the background, you can pass the -d flag (for "detached" mode) to docker compose up and use docker compose ps to see what is currently running:
docker compose up -d
6.docker compose stop
